Experiment 2 - Program to implement a mul-layer perceptron (MLP) network with one hidden layer using numpy in Python using the demostration that it can learn the XOR Boolean function.

The model contains a single hidden layer, an input layer and a ouput layer. The output layer contains a single perceptron and the hidden layer contains four perceptron. 
The four perceptrons are trained on the basis of boolean inputs using "Perceptron Learning Algorithm" where step function is used as activation function. 
After training each perceptron of hidden layer give positive output only for a single combination of boolean inputs. 
Finally the output perceptron is trained using the "Perceptron Learning Algorithm" where the inputs given are the outputs from 
each trained perceptron of the hidden layer & it gives the output mimicking the XOR function.
