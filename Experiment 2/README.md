<h2>Experiment 2</h2>
Program to implement a mul-layer perceptron (MLP) network with one hidden layer using numpy in Python using the demostration that it can learn the XOR Boolean function.

<h3>Model Description</h3>
The model contains a single hidden layer, an input layer and a ouput layer. The output layer contains a single perceptron and the hidden layer contains four perceptron. <br><br>
The four perceptrons are trained on the basis of boolean inputs using "Perceptron Learning Algorithm" where step function is used as activation function. <br><br>
After training each perceptron of hidden layer give positive output only for a single combination of boolean inputs. <br>
Finally the output perceptron is trained using the "Perceptron Learning Algorithm" where the inputs given are the outputs from 
each trained perceptron of the hidden layer & it gives the output mimicking the XOR function.
